    <p>Winona La Duke (200l)</p>
<p>It is Manoominike-Giizis, the wild rice moon, and the lakes teem with a harvest and a way of life. "Ever since I was bitty, I've been ricing," reminisces Spud Fineday, of Ice Cracking Lake. Spud, with his wife Tater, rice at Cabin Point, and then move to Big Flat Lake, lakes on Minnesota's White Earth Reservation. "Sometimes we can knock four to five hundred pounds a day, " he says, explaining that he alternates the jobs of "poling and knocking" with his wife, Tater, a.k.a. Vanessa Fineday. The Finedays, like many other Anishinaabeg from White Earth, and other reservations in the region, continue to rice, to feed their families, to "buy school clothes and fix cars", and get ready for the ever returning winter. The wild rice harvest of the Anishinaabeg not only feeds the body, it feeds the soul, continuing a tradition which is generations old for these people of the lakes and rivers of the north. While Spud Fineday, remembers ricing since he was a child, it is a community event, a cultural event, which ties the community intergenerationally to all that is essentially Anishinaabeg, Ojibwe.</p>
<p>It is fifteen hundred miles away and I'm not sure that Ken Foster has ever seen a northern Minnesota lake as the wild rice softly sways in the warm wind of Manoominike Giizis. . Nor perhaps has he ever heard a loon, calling a mate across the deep blues of the lake. Perhaps he should. Ken Foster, along with colleague Zan Hua Zahn of NORCAL Wild Rice, in Woodland, California have successfully patented wild rice. US Patent number 5955.648 is a patent on zizania palustris, which uses "cytoplasmic genetic male sterility," allowing for better commercial production of wild rice. It seems almost impossible in itself- patenting something called wild rice. Yet, in the age of Dolly the cloned sheep, and a patent proposed even on human genome stock, wild rice has become yet another frontier in the brave new world of technology.</p>
<p>University of Minnesota Plant geneticist Ron Phillips along with a few colleagues from the field, have just finished mapping the wild rice genome. Phillips is an affable guy, who looks at his work as strictly scientific. However, the research Phillips is conducting promises to be for more than just the sake of science. Phillips writes in his recent study that his work is considered, " important as a foundation for genetic and crop improvement studies'(the map of wild rice) is ' the reference point for mapping and gene cloning'"</p>
<p>While the future uses of such scientific data are at present unknown, we can be relatively assured as to who will most likely reap the benefits of this knowledge. The $21 million wild rice business is largely dominated by just a few paddy rice firms. Their interest in genetic work on wild rice stems largely from their own economic interests, not environmental, humanitarian, or tribal interests. More than that, University collaboration with seed companies may be common practice, but when two of the four researchers in the wild rice genome study (Grombacher and Kennard) come from little companies like Dupont and Monsanto, some of us take notice.</p>
<p>Monsanto and Dupont are the two largest seed companies in the world. Monsanto alone has spent upwards of $ 8 billion in the last couple of years buying up US seed companies and Dupont recently purchased Pioneer, the second largest seed company in the world. This concentration of control over world seed stocks is alarming to farmers on a worldwide scale, especially considering that the closer seeds seem to be held, the fewer there are. Consider that on a worldwide scale some l0,000 plus food plants are consumed, yet a mere 103 account for 90% of the world's food crops. In the US alone, between five and twenty percent (dependent on the crop) of varieties found in a l904 inventory of crops are still grown commercially or held in collections. Similarly, China has experienced a 90% loss in wheat varieties since World War II alone. In terms natural varieties ( as opposed to domesticated), the World Conservation Union reported in l997, that one out of eight plants surveyed internationally ( out of 240,000 " higher species" of plants), is potentially at risk, with extinction rates presently at l000 species a year- the highest extinction rates of plants, is ironically, in the United States. However you cut the statistics, from the villages of India, to the villages of northern Minnesota, there is a marked loss in worldwide biodiversity, and a closer hold on who controls the remaining seeds of the world</p>
<p>Finally, there is Monsanto's track record quandary. As Peter Montegue writes in Mother Jones, "Monsanto is a corporation which specializes in genetically modified seeds, seeds having particular properties that Monsanto has patented." That particular interest became sort of a problem in the case of the so-called terminator seed. These seeds do not reproduce. This ensured Monsanto's financial security because it forced farmers, who would usually save seed from one crop to the next, to buy seeds every year, a huge problem for millions of poor farmers worldwide. As well, some of the new genetically modified seeds ( especially those containing a toxin produced by Bacillus thuringienus or Bt) seem to render deadly milkweed, the food of monarch butterflies, which illustrates, one facet of the complications associated with the other seed companies interests in genetically modified crops. While we can't be sure of the future of the wild rice genome studies, nor the interest in patents of wild rice, we can be sure that companies like Monsanto don't come to wild rice country without a lot of suitcases. .</p>
<p>Wild rice, or zizania palustris is actually a grass, sharing only some genetic strains with other rice crops internationally. That special nature is part of what drives its niche market and the millions of dollars now behind the industry. Over the past thirty years what the Creator gave to the Anishinaabeg has become a profit making enterprise for many others. By 1968, Minnesota's paddy wild rice production already represented some 20% of the state's crop. Paddy rice production increased the available quantities of wild rice, and by 1973, had amplified the yield to some 4 million pounds. The increase in production, growing national public demand, and subsequent interest by the larger corporations (ie: Uncle Ben's, Green Giant and General Foods) permanently altered the market of traditional wild rice. Lake harvested rice could no longer effectively compete in price with the corporations' mass-manufactured paddy crop. Then in 1977, the Minnesota state legislature designated wild rice as Minnesota's official state grain. That was perhaps the kiss of death for the lake wild rice harvest. With an outpouring from the state coffers, the University of Minnesota departments aggressively began to develop a domesticated version of the wild rice crop. By the early 1980's cultivated (paddy grown) wild rice had outstripped the Indigenous varieties in production.</p>
<p>Ironically, the state of Minnesota lost control over wild rice production (that official state grain) to the state of California, which by 1983 produced over 8.3 million pounds, compared to Minnesota's five million pounds. By 1986, more than 95% of the wild rice harvested was paddy grown, the vast majority produced in northern California. Today, only fifteen percent of Minnesota's 7-million-pound wild rice output is harvested from lakes-the rest is culled by machines from paddies. California growers continue to lead the nation in wild rice production; increasing production by about half a million pounds each year. When the glut of wild rice hit the market in 1986, it flooded the market, causing the prices to plummet. Not only was the newly emerging domesticated market affected, but also the Native wild rice economy was devastated as lakeside prices crashed. Not only did many Ojibwe lose their source of livelihood, but to add insult to injury, many of the paddy rice companies were selling a product as if it was " wild rice", even in some cases using Ojibwe images in their advertising.</p>
<p>The Ojibwe decided to fight back. In 1988, Wabizii v. Busch Agricultural Resources was filed, a lawsuit ostensibly on the issues of false and misleading advertising. Busch Agricultural Resources ( a division of the beer conglomerate) marketed a product called "Onamia Wild Rice," which the plaintiff Frank Bibeau charged was in fact a California-grown paddy product disguised as "authentic" Minnesota lake rice. "They had two Indians on a canoe who appeared to be picking wild rice. They were packaging a California grown product, trucking it to Minnesota, where it was packaged and designated as a Minnesota product," stated Bibeau. Bibeau, a White Earth tribal member, is today an attorney for the Leech Lake tribal government, but at the time was a small wild rice producer who processed pretty much just to supplement family income. The case was eventually settled out of court but the intent was to begin addressing the difference between paddy grown wild rice and Native lake harvested wild rice. "We had been overly patient and polite with the state of Minnesota, waiting for them to enforce their laws, yet they refused to make even one complaint for false and misleading advertising, and it became obvious that the only recourse for us was to file suit. "The result was also a law, forcing Minnesota paddy wild rice producers to label their product as such, with the lettering (paddy rice) no less than half the size of the words wild rice on the advertising. A small victory, but sort of a slippery slope in the age of globalization.</p>
<p>Some things change and some things might get worse. Although University researchers like Ron Phillips distance themselves from "genetic engineering," Phillips admits that there is a small possibility of some transference between the two varieties. When asked if the domesticated strain of the stronger paddy rice might possibly overpower the wild strains in the lakes and rivers, Phillips answered," The probability is low because it's not designed to re-seed itself' It could survive, it's not the kind of thing you could control perfectly." A few scientists at the University of Minnesota admit, however, that the tribes may have some need for concern, writing, " I am certain that you agree there are legitimate local/regional impacts and potential research areas involving wild rice that can make a huge difference to communities in the state. The bands have an enormous stake in the outcomes of wild rice research conducted here'" Just a small possibility of any genetic alteration of the rice is enough to concern the Ojibwe. Joe LaGarde, from the White Earth reservation voices the concerns of many, "Man thinks he can improve on something that's been developing over thousands of years. Eventually, he might end up with nothing." LaGarde even points out that the genetic diversity of the natural wild rice is one of its strengths. "There's sandy bottom rice (usually shorter grains), muddy bottom rice, all of that," Joe explains. "We're concerned about the possible (crossbreeding) of these 'hybrid cultivated varieties' with our lake rice." The Minnesota Chippewa Tribe ( MCT) ,echoed this concern, in a letter to the University of Minnesota. "' We object to anyone exploiting our treaty wild rice genus for pecuniary gain," then MCT President Norman Deschampe wrote in late l998, "The genetic variants of wild rice found naturally occurring on the waters in the territories ceded by the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe to the State of Minnesota are a unique treasure that has been carefully protected by the people of our tribe for centuries. Rights to the rice have been the subject of treaty and is a resource that enjoys federal trust protection. 'We are of the opinion that the wild rice rights assured by treaty accrue not only to individual grains of rice, but to the very essence of the resource. We were not promised just any wild rice, that promise could be kept by delivering sacks of grain to our members each year. We were promised the rice that grew in the waters of our people, and all the value that rice holds' A sacred and significant place in our culture'." At the other end is the paddy grown rice market-which now serves consumers who demand a big black grain, rice, which cooks up at exactly the same pace as their white rice. That market is huge. Companies like Stouffers , Uncle Bens, Fall River and Gibbs Wild Rice are all big names in the industry. The largest wild rice processor in the country, has some Minnesota origins, but today processes everything in California. Indian Harvest is pretty much an operation with few "Indians", although some lake rice was historically in their program. This year, the company will likely process around 13 million pounds of wild rice, or some 75% of the national crop. Indian Harvest reflects the national trends, and market in wild rice, which remains focused on the cultivated varieties. Jerry Schochenmaier, (now deceased ) was the manager of Indian Harvest for over a decade, and remembered it's origins. In 1989, Indian Harvest processed some 1 million pounds, by 1994; production was up to 6 million pounds, increasing to a projected 13 million pounds in 1999. "The rice mill was originally designed to be in Bemidji (the footings for the building are still at Bemidji's industrial park), but California was identified as the place to produce rice, if you were going into the business. "California's assets are control over the variables-water is bought, not rained down, no wind, and no hail. You just "put it in, tend to it, and harvest it, pretty much like any other grain crop."</p>
<p>The rice found in the major markets, is quite different from the rice, most of us see in northern Minnesota. Commercially processed wild rice, for Uncle Ben's, Gourmet House, Pillsbury, Stouffer's, General Mills, Con Agra, and the other big companies is processed black, parboiled and scarified, so as "to get its cook time to match that of white rice", explained Schochenmaier,</p>
<p>I 'd probably call Indian Harvest Wild Rice, Dutch Harvest Wild Rice. The company is owned by a American Dutch family based holding corporation, Duininck , large asphalt , highway and heavy construction business from Prinsburg, Minnesota. And, both present general manager Gene Adding, and California plant manager Don Kuken ( both of whom are really nice guys) are Dutch. In my tour of the California plant, I didn't see a single Native person from North America, that is, although there were a large number of Mexican American workers who were employed at the plant, just like the rest of the California agriculture industry. Asked about the origins of the name, Adding recalls, " The original wild rice that they sold was hand harvested, that was the tradition in Minnesota. Once you build up a name and identity with the customers, it's hard to change. I think it was founded on correct principles , whether or not that has followed through, that might be something someone would want to look at some time." Sort of a question of possibly misleading advertising, I might say, but , in the era of Cherokee jeeps, Crazy Horse Beer, and Indian Motorcycles, appropriation seems rather wanton.</p>
<p>While paddy rice continues to flourish in diked paddies of northern California, it may be diminishing the native rice stands in the north country of Minnesota. There are a number of problems. One culprit is the water levels, who controls them and why. Dale Greene, a traditional leader from the Rice Lake Band of Anishinaabeg, tells us that Rice Lake itself (near McGregor, Minnesota, as opposed to Rice Lake on the White Earth Reservation) began a decline in production in 1934, when the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service dammed the lake and managed it for waterfowl production. Organic material was then trapped in the water. "There's so much sediment on the bottom, the seeds never get to the bottom to germinate," he explains. "There used to be 300-500 boats out here. Now'maybe 40'on a good year."</p>
<p>Other threats include invasive plants, pollution, boat traffic, agricultural run-off, and, of course, the beaver. While beavers have obviously coexisted with rice beds for thousands of years, a decline in trapping and a virtual removal of natural predators (i.e.: wolves), means beavers, with all their ambition, rule the north woodlands. The Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, among many interests, argues that the University and state of Minnesota's money could be better spent on some habitat issues. John Persell, Director of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe's research lab points to the thousands of acres of wild rice that have been destroyed by state development projects, and argues for both state work to protect the natural stands, and more state enforcement of labeling laws.</p>
<p>All of this translates to a loss of biodiversity and income for those who perhaps need it most. Even a University of Minnesota wild rice agronomist, who nurtured the paddy crop, is concerned. The fact is wild rice is a "reservoir of genetic diversity" which is also invaluable to plant geneticists and the cultivated industry."We should be concerned about losing any kind of plant species, because we never know what they might be useful for," says Ervin Oelke, a University of Minnesota agronomist who has worked with wild rice for more than 20 years, and was quite instrumental in its commercialization. "With wild rice in particular we're concerned because we are now in the process of domesticating the species. It's important we have all the genetics that are available to us to [further] develop this crop."</p>
<p>The differences in wild rice beds are well known to local harvesters. Some plants grow tall and live in deep water; others have adapted to shallow water. Some strains have fat grains; others have long grains. All of those genetics help even the paddy rice industry. It is, in the end a twisted irony. What Gichi Manidoo gave the Anishinaabeg suffers under public policy, only perhaps, until the interest of those who forgot it is sparked, by the potential of its genetic wealth, to their own interests. All of these factors inevitably link the wild rice of a remote Native community to worldwide debates on biodiversity, genetic engineering, and indeed, the future of our foods. While international taste buds and global corporations have one idea of what is wild rice, their market driven impacts have been felt on the lakes of the White Earth Reservation and throughout the north- country. Increasingly tribal governments nationally and internationally are looking to enact tribal ordinances preserving their intellectual and cultural property rights, finding that these reservoirs of genetic diversity that lie within Indigenous communities should be guarded, in any case, so that future generations may have some part in their continued relations with the broader ecosystem in which we live. In the state of Minnesota, however, it is clear that there is much less state regulatory interest in ecological preservation of the rice; there are fewer buyers, at lower prices. But, so long as there is rice, there will always be ricers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, back on Round Lake, a pick up truck pulls up at the rice mill. Eugene Davis and Tony Warren bring in around 300 pounds of rice off of South Chippewa Lake. They are tired, wet from the recurring rain of morning, but they are happy. "This is the only job, we can make $50 an hour at up here", 20-year-old Eugene Davis tells me. "I like it when it rains out there, it's nice, you can't hear anything but the rain". It is that peace which brings the ricers back. It is also the memories. I ask Eugene Davis what he thinks about the fact that probably five or ten generations of his family have riced on South Chippewa Lake. "I like knowing that they was on the same lake, it makes me feel good", he responds and smiles.</p>
<p>To the rest of the ricers of White Earth, this season, the Ojibwe Wild Ricing Moon-Manoominikegiizis, is the season of a harvest, a ceremony, and a way of life. "I grew up doing that," reflects Spud Fineday. "You get to visit people you haven't seen for a whole year, because just about everyone goes ricing". Far away, a combine is harvesting paddy grown wild rice somewhere in California, and consumers are eating a very different food. The Anishinaabeg would not trade for the rice, or the combine. In the end, this rice tastes like a lake, and that taste, cannot be replicated.</p>
