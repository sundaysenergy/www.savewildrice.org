    <h3>Legislation heard to Protect Wild Rice from Genetic Contamination</h3>
<p> St. Paul: Earlier this week State Representative Frank Moe (DFL 04 A) and State Senator Becky Lourey (DFL 08) in conjunction with tribal communities, introduced legislation to protect Minnesota&#39;s state grain, wild rice.  Testimony was heard in the House Agriculture and Rural Development Committee on Tuesday on the bill, HF 3915, which requires a two year moratorium on the introduction of Genetically Engineered wild rice in the state, which would be triggered by an application for a test plot of GE wild rice filed anywhere within the US.  During the two-year moratorium the State Departments of Agriculture and Natural Resources would be required to conduct research on the Agronomic, Economic, Environmental, and Cultural impacts of introducing GE wild rice in Minnesota.  Rep. Moe explained that â€œWild rice is our state grain, and is unique in its importance to the Native Community.  Wild Rice is different from other crops, so we need to ask more questions about the impacts of genetic engineering on this native plant.â€  If genetically engineered wild rice is developed and introduced, natural stands in lakes and rivers could be genetically contaminated, through pollen drift, or insect and animal movement of pollen and seeds.  Contamination would mean a loss of European, Asian, and some domestic markets for both hand-harvesters and cultivated wild rice farmers, as well as potential environmental problems.  Wild rice is also part of the culture of the state, particularly for Native peoples.  Winona LaDuke, founding director of the White Earth Land Recovery Project, spoke about the importance of wild rice to the culture and tradition of the Anishinaabe people.  â€œOur prophecies instructed the Anishinaabe to migrate west to where the food grows on the water.  That food is Manoomin, or wild rice, and it holds great significance to our people.  The Creator gave us wild rice to care for as a sacred food, and protecting it from genetic engineering is part of that responsibilityâ€ said Ms. LaDuke.  John Persell, Minnesota Chippewa Tribe Water Quality Director, testified about wild rice as a natural resource, which is so vitally important for the tribes that is protected by treaty.  He explained, â€œNatural wild rice stands provide vital wildlife habitat, help combat erosion and keep our rivers and lakes clean.  I would look at the introduction of GE Wild Rice as a potential invasive species that could potentially devastate the Natural stands.â€  Dennis Olson, of the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, testified on a report that was issued by the US Department of Agricuture&#39;s (USDA) auditor, the Office of Inspector General, which found that the department has failed to properly oversee field trials of genetically engineered crops, including plants designed to produce chemicals for medical and industrial uses. Olson stated, â€œCurrently, weaknesses in regulations and in the internal management controls at the USDA, according to their own studies â€˜increase the risk that genetically engineered organisms will inadvertently persist in the environment before they are deemed safe to grow without regulation.â€™  There are not adequate federal protections in place to protect wild riceâ€  There were several groups that testified against the bill including Monsanto, the Biotechnology Industry Organization, and the State Department of Agriculture, whose main concerns were that this would send the wrong message to the Biotech Community that Minnesota is opposed to Genetic Engineering.  In response LaDuke stated, â€œIf the State Legislature and the State Dept. of Agriculture under Governor Pawlenty, are unwilling to protect wild rice, the message that sends to the Native Communities and the outside world is that Minnesota has wild rice; a unique food, their state grain, integral to their lakes ecosystem, and sacred to their Native bands, and given that there are some real problems with test plot inspection and enforcement, the fact that they aren&#39;t taking extra care to protect it is foolish and offensive.â€</p>
